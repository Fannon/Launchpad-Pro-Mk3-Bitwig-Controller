# Launchpad Pro Mk3 Bitwig Controller

## Description

> This is currently a playground and work in progress.
> Right now this doesn't do anything useful.

## Goals

- Use the Launchpad Pro Mk3 in Bitwig without loosing the built in functionality
- Only add what is not part of built in functionality
  - Session Mode
  - Transport / Track management (?)
  - BPM
- Use the Launchpad mostly like described in the manual
- Write this in TypeScript, with a more functional approach (data + functions instead of classes / prototypes)

## Alternatives

- https://github.com/git-moss/DrivenByMoss Bitwig Extension
  - DrivenByMoss can do much more than this extension
  - The design goals are quite different, though
